Emacs version: GNU emacs 24.3
Author: Bence Kalmar

Emacs using this repository is most often run by the command:
  emacsclient -c -a ""
which starts an emacs server if not running already, and connects to it on a new
frame.  It is of course possible to use it running regular emacs instead of
a client, but it is customized to work best with the above command.

This repository is customized for GNU/Linux and Windows, but it could well be
used the exact same way on other operating systems (e.g. Mac OS X) with minimal
additional customization (some functions).

No third-party packages are included.  Most of them are downloaded from online
ELPA package archives automatically; some of them MUST BE DOWNLOADED MANUALLY,
as there is no recent version of them in online package archives.  For more
information, check `packages/manual/README'.

Some third-party themes are included.  For more information, check
`themes/README'.

Feel free to use and modify any of the files in this repository as you please.
