Packages that are manually installed are placed here.

Updating this directory is done manually.  This involves downloading, modifying
and compiling new files.

Only packages whose newest version is not in any archive should be installed
manually.

Each package has its own directory, in the form `packagename-version', where
packagename is the name of the package, and version is the version (one or more
numbers separated by dots).

The following packages are placed here:
