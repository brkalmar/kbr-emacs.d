Manually installed packages should be placed in this directory.

Updating these packages is done manually.  This involves downloading, modifying
and compiling new files.

Each package has its own directory, in the form `packagename-version`, where
`packagename` is the name of the package, and `version` is the version (one or
more numbers separated by dots).  This is the same format `package.el` uses.
